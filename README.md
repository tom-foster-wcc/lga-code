# Sources

We are using data sources from the ONS, as well as from our own internal system geospatial system.

One of the files is too large to upload to Github and can be found at the following link:

* [Population estimates for Lower layer super output areas (LSOA) in England and Wales, single year of age and sex, mid-2001 to mid-2017](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/adhocs/009983populationestimatesforlowerlayersuperoutputareaslsoainenglandandwalessingleyearofageandsexmid2001tomid2017)

The other sources in the data folder exist as part of the project however, for population estimates you can find them at:
* [Lower layer Super Output Area population estimates (supporting information - we used 2018 and 2019)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/lowersuperoutputareamidyearpopulationestimates)

From our own internal system we have used a joined tables related to local names. For the purposes of reproducibility. This has been stored in the data folder as `local_names.csv`.
